                    Self proclaimed nerd, technologist, gamer, & avid learner.<br>
                    An organized chaos of my work, interests, & accomplishments.<br>

                <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>
					My passion for technology began early, fueled by a love of video games and an insatiable curiosity that led me 
					to take apart anything I could get my hands on. This interest eventually guided me into the IT industry, where 
					I landed my first tech role at a small startup in sunny Orange County, California. I started in technical support 
					and soon transitioned into manual QA and automation testing. When the startup was acquired by Scotts Miracle-Gro, 
					I relocated to Colorado shortly after. There, I realized I thrive in smaller companies where I can wear multiple hats 
					and make a meaningful impact. This led me to a PBX manufacturer and telecom company, where I deepened my understanding 
					of the IT industry, rapidly expanded my skill set, and built lasting professional relationships.
                </p>
                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>
					Video games have always been more than just a hobby—they’ve shaped who I am. It all started with a Game Boy Color and Pokémon, 
					then progressed through the Nintendo 64, GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation, and eventually PC gaming. Building my first gaming rig 
					(the same machine I’m typing this on today) was a turning point. World of Warcraft became a huge part of my life; I sank countless 
					hours into it, formed incredible friendships across the globe, and even met one of my best friends to this day, Dustin, through 
					the game. Those experiences taught me collaboration, problem-solving, and the joy of connecting with people over shared passions—skills 
					that still serve me in tech.
                </p>
                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p>
					Cooking has been another lifelong love, one that turned into a necessity when I moved out on my own. I owe almost everything I 
					know in the kitchen to my incredible friend Dustin—he patiently taught me the fundamentals and beyond, and I’ll always be grateful 
					for his guidance. These days I’m especially proud of my mapo tofu, Sichuan eggplant, street-style tacos, and anything pan-seared—fish, 
					steaks, chops, you name it. If it can go in a hot pan or the oven with good seasoning and technique, I’m confident I can make it delicious.
                <h3>Plants & Bio-tech</h3>
                <p>
					Plants have fascinated me since I was a kid. Over the years I’ve explored horticulture and gardening, experimented with hydroponics and 
					aeroponics, and dove deep into earthen-building techniques. My long-term dream is to one day own a piece of land and build a fully self-sustaining 
					earthship with my own hands—an off-grid home that grows its own food, recycles its water, and runs on renewable energy. Everything I learn, from 
					IT to cooking to growing plants, feels like it’s leading me toward that goal.

				<h3>Desktop Setup</h3>
                <p>
					I recently upgraded my desktop rig from an aging GTX 1080 to a beastly NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (TUF edition).
					What makes this setup truly unique is that the heart of the system is a compact mini PC connected to the GPU via
					a PCIe dock—delivering massive performance in a surprisingly small footprint.

					Current Desktop Specs
				</p>	
					<ul>
						<li>Operating system: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro, Version 10.0.26200</li>
						<li>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 9 285H</li>
						<li>RAM: 96.0 GB</li>
						<li>Storage (2): SSD - 931.5 GB,SSD - 931.5 GB</li>
						
						<li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</li>
						<li>CUDA cores: 8960</li>
						<li>Graphics clock: 2588 MHz</li>
						<li>Memory data rate: 28.00 Gbps</li>
						<li>Memory interface: 256-bit</li>
						<li>Memory bandwidth: 896.064 GB/s</li>
						<li>Total available graphics memory: 65245 MB</li>
						<li>Dedicated video memory: 16303 MB GDDR7</li>
						<li>Bus: PCI Express x8</li>
					
						<li>Display (1): Samsung Odyssey G93SC</li>
						<li>Resolution: 5120 x 1440</li>
						<li>Refresh rate: 240 Hz</li>
						<li>Desktop color depth: Highest (32-bit)</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					Paired with the setup is my all-time favorite keyboard: the Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB) Professional Hybrid Type-S—topre switches, compact layout, pure bliss.
					For the mouse, I run the Zowie EC2-DW 4K wireless, which delivers incredibly satisfying clicky feedback and precision. Audio duties are handled by the Audeze
					Maxwell headset—phenomenal sound and comfort for long sessions. And last but not least the Samsung Odysey G9 OLED driving the front end of things.
                </p>

				<h3>Laptop Setup</h3>
                <p>
                   For daily work in networking, VoIP, and cybersecurity, nothing beats Linux in my experience. My go-to machine is a System76 laptop running Pop!_OS,
				   offering a rock-solid, encrypted environment that's fast and distraction-free.
					
					Laptop Specs:
				</p>	
					<ul>
						<li>Operating System: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS with full disk-encryption</li>
						<li>Display: 14" Matte Full HD+</li>
						<li>Processor: 5.1 GHz Intel Core Ultra 7 255H (16 Cores)</li>
						<li>Networking: WiFi 7 + Bluetooth 5.4</li>
						<li>Memory: 32 GB DDR5 5600 MHz (2x16)</li>
						<li>OS Drive: 1 TB PCIe4 M.2 SSD</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Motorcycles</h3>
                <p>
					I've got a small collection of bikes, but my absolute favorite is the 2023 Harley-Davidson Low Rider S. There's simply nothing like cracking the throttle
					open and letting that Milwaukee-Eight 117 torque pull you forward. California is a rider's paradise, and my favorite stretches are in San Diego, Orange County,
					and the Beach Cities. Whether it's cruising down the PCH with the ocean on one side or carving through twisty mountain roads, the year-round perfect weather makes every ride S-tier.
