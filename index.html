                <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>
					My passion for technology began early, fueled by a love of video games and an insatiable curiosity that led me 
					to take apart anything I could get my hands on. This interest eventually guided me into the IT industry, where 
					I landed my first tech role at a small startup in sunny Orange County, California. I started in technical support 
					and soon transitioned into manual QA and automation testing. When the startup was acquired by Scotts Miracle-Gro, 
					I relocated to Colorado shortly after. There, I realized I thrive in smaller companies where I can wear multiple hats 
					and make a meaningful impact. This led me to a PBX manufacturer and telecom company, where I deepened my understanding 
					of the IT industry, rapidly expanded my skill set, and built lasting professional relationships.
                </p>
                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>
					Video games have always been more than just a hobby—they’ve shaped who I am. It all started with a Game Boy Color and Pokémon, 
					then progressed through the Nintendo 64, GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation, and eventually PC gaming. Building my first gaming rig 
					(the same machine I’m typing this on today) was a turning point. World of Warcraft became a huge part of my life; I sank countless 
					hours into it, formed incredible friendships across the globe, and even met one of my best friends to this day, Dustin, through 
					the game. Those experiences taught me collaboration, problem-solving, and the joy of connecting with people over shared passions—skills 
					that still serve me in tech.
                </p>
                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p>
					Cooking has been another lifelong love, one that turned into a necessity when I moved out on my own. I owe almost everything I 
					know in the kitchen to my incredible friend Dustin—he patiently taught me the fundamentals and beyond, and I’ll always be grateful 
					for his guidance. These days I’m especially proud of my mapo tofu, Sichuan eggplant, street-style tacos, and anything pan-seared—fish, 
					steaks, chops, you name it. If it can go in a hot pan or the oven with good seasoning and technique, I’m confident I can make it delicious.
                <h3>Plants & Bio-tech</h3>
                <p>
					Plants have fascinated me since I was a kid. Over the years I’ve explored horticulture and gardening, experimented with hydroponics and 
					aeroponics, and dove deep into earthen-building techniques. My long-term dream is to one day own a piece of land and build a fully self-sustaining 
					earthship with my own hands—an off-grid home that grows its own food, recycles its water, and runs on renewable energy. Everything I learn, from 
					IT to cooking to growing plants, feels like it’s leading me toward that goal.

                    I recently upgrade my Desktop Rig that was running a GTX 1080 to an RTX 5070 Ti TUF edition. The cool thing about this my new desktop setup is that it's a mini PC and sits on a PICe dock to connect
					the GPU to the Mini PC.

					As for my keyboard and mouse I'm using the HHK (Happy Hacking Keyboard) Professional HYBRID Type-S, and the mouse is the Zowie EC2-DW 4k Wireless, absolutely love the feeling of the HHK keyboard and
					the clicky actuation of the mouse

					For my headset I'm using the Audeze Maxwell

					And last but not least the Samsung Odysey G9 OLED
                </p>
				<h3>Motorcycles</h3>
                <p>
                	I have a few motorcycles but my favorite one is my 2023 Harley Davidson Lowrider S. There's nothing better than twisting that throttle and feeling the torque take you wherever you want.
					My favorite places to ride in California are San Diego, Orange County, and Beach Cities. From PCH cruises to mountain road twsities, California has some of the best S tier year round riding
					you could wish for.
