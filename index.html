                <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>
					My passion for technology began early, fueled by a love of video games and an insatiable curiosity that led me 
					to take apart anything I could get my hands on. This interest eventually guided me into the IT industry, where 
					I landed my first tech role at a small startup in sunny Orange County, California. I started in technical support 
					and soon transitioned into manual QA and automation testing. When the startup was acquired by Scotts Miracle-Gro, 
					I relocated to Colorado shortly after. There, I realized I thrive in smaller companies where I can wear multiple hats 
					and make a meaningful impact. This led me to a PBX manufacturer and telecom company, where I deepened my understanding 
					of the IT industry, rapidly expanded my skill set, and built lasting professional relationships.
                </p>
                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>
					Video games have always been more than just a hobby, they’ve shaped who I am. It all started with a Game Boy Color and Pokémon, 
					then progressed through the Nintendo 64, GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation, and eventually PC gaming. Building my first gaming rig 
					(the same machine I’m typing this on today) was a turning point. World of Warcraft became a huge part of my life; I sank countless 
					hours into it, formed incredible friendships across the globe, and even met one of my best friends to this day, Dustin, through 
					the game. Those experiences taught me collaboration, problem-solving, and the joy of connecting with people over shared passions. Skills 
					that still serve me in tech.
                </p>
                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p>
					Cooking has been another lifelong love, one that turned into a necessity when I moved out on my own. I owe almost everything I 
					know in the kitchen to my incredible friend Dustin who patiently taught me the fundamentals and beyond, and I’ll always be grateful 
					for his guidance. These days I’m especially proud of my mapo tofu, Sichuan eggplant, street-style tacos, and anything pan-seared—fish, 
					steaks, chops, you name it. If it can go in a hot pan or the oven, I’m confident I can make it delicious.
                <h3>Plants & Bio-tech</h3>
                <p>
					Plants have fascinated me since I was a kid. Over the years I’ve explored horticulture and gardening, experimented with hydroponics and 
					aeroponics, and dove deep into earthen-building techniques. My long-term dream is to one day own a piece of land and build a fully self-sustaining 
					earthship with my own hands. An off-grid home that grows its own food, recycles its water, and runs on renewable energy. Everything I learn, from 
					IT to cooking to growing plants, feels like it’s leading me toward that goal.
                </p>
				<h3>Motorcycles</h3>
                <p>
					I've got a small collection of bikes, but my absolute favorite is the 2023 Harley-Davidson Low Rider S. There's simply nothing like cracking the throttle
					open and letting that Milwaukee-Eight 117 torque pull you forward. California is a rider's paradise, and my favorite stretches are in San Diego, Orange County,
					and the Beach Cities. Whether it's cruising down the PCH with the ocean on one side or carving through twisty mountain roads, the year round perfect weather makes every ride memorable.

					The next few motorcycles I'd like would be an old shovelhead or sportster chopper as a project bike, a early 2000s Dyna (if you know you know, looking at you Dyna bros), and a Honda CBR just for the Hell of it.

					  <summary>Architecture</summary>
					  <p>
					  		In my own personal experience, when it comes to installation PBX servers there are generally two scenarios you will run into, at least in my line of work in Hotel/SOHO PBX environments, which, in all fairness is going the way of the Dodo. Nevertheless, let's dive in!<br>
							You will typically see Host based and Premise based PBX installs, there's also an interesting host+proxy install you can run into as well but we will touch on that at the end, also please keep in mind this is not an exhaustive list of ways to do this, these are just typically what I work in on the daily. :)<br>
							Host based PBX solution:<br>
						  	The companies I worked for will use AWS but ultimately it doesn't matter which cloud provider you wish to use, that will boil down to what your needs and experience are. So in the cloud you will have an Asterisk/FreePBX/insertFlavorOfPBXYouWantHere.<br>
						  	On premise you will typically have a firewall, switch, SIP Phones (hardware based or software based), Analog phones, NVT Phybridge Analog to SIP converters for connecting your SIP phones RJ45 port to an RJ11 2-pair port, and Analog to SIP gateways for true analog devices. This is not an exhaustive list as you will obviously have further materials and components, this is a very high level overview.<br>
						  	How will this somewhat look like and how will this all connect you might ask? Great question!<br>
						  	In short it will look something like this top down in a server rack:<br>
						  	Patch Panel - Neat and manageable cable management<br>
						  	Firewall - Routing and remote access<br>
						  	Switch - VLAN support prefably to connect all your components together<br>
						  	PBX - Call routing, Trunks, Queues, Ring Groups, the heard of the setup essentially!<br>
						  	NVT Phybridge - Allows you to run SIP phones over 2-pair cross connect wire<br>
						  	Analog Gateways - Allows you to connect analog phones to the PBX via SIP registartion<br>
						  	PDU and UPS - Protects equipment in event of brownouts/hard shutdowns<br>

									Downloaded ProxMox VE ISO<br>
									Used Rufus to format USB stick for ISO install<br>
									Plugged USB into old Dell server<br>
									Booted into BIOS and booted from USB stick<br>
									Chose graphical install<br>
									Set Target Harddisk to the single SSD 1tb drive in the dell server using an xfs file system (if multiple drives/redundant setup I would have used ZFS)<br>
									Setup region<br>
									Setup admin password and email address<br>
									Set static IP<br>
									Rebooted and completed the install<br>
									
									loaded my kali ISO under my local storage on node localhost and added and ISO image, under "ISO Images"<br>
									Went to top right hand corner of ProxMox and clicked on Create VM<br>
									went through the standard setup options to configure hardware<br>
									started my install<br>
									note to anyone else - if you see your image install just keep looping don't forget to change the boot order/remove the iso image from the cd/rom under your vms hardware :)<br>
									logged into kali and updated and upgraded my packages<br>
									created a base line snapshot<br><br>
									
									loaded my ubuntu iso under my local storage on node localhost and added ISO image under "ISO images"<br>
									followed roughly the same steps for kali<br><br>
									
									Same thing for windows eval, however, I need to also install virtio-win.iso by putting it into the hardware cd rom and then finding it in my windows 10 VM and installing it.<br><br>

									For metasploitable, slightly different, had to upload the .vmdk via scp to proxmox server:<br><br>

					Paired with the setup is my all-time favorite keyboard: the Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB) Professional Hybrid Type S topre switches, compact layout, pure bliss.
					For the mouse, I run the Zowie EC2-DW 4K wireless, which delivers incredibly satisfying clicky feedback and precision. Audio duties are handled by the Audeze
					Maxwell headset whcih offer phenomenal sound and comfort for long sessions. And last but not least the Samsung Odysey G9 OLED driving the front end of things.
